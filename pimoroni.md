# Sofle Pico Pimoroni Support
@todo add image here.

The Sofle Pico was designed with Pimoroni support. The outermost column of pins on the patch bay are intended for use with the Pimoroni. However - after trying it out, the experience is not great, so it's not recommended.  The cursor movement is 'jenky' at best. 


QMK does [officially support](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_pointing_device?id=pimoroni-trackball) the Pimoroni. There may be a way to improve the movement in QMK. 

If you find a way to make this work well, please submit a PR. An additional mounting bracket will likely need to be designed to position the trackball comfortably.
