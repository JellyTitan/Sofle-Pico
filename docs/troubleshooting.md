## Plug in the USB cable and nothing happens
Cheap cables shipped for charging toys/lights/gadgets sometimes leave out the data-wires or don't actually implement the reversible pin-out on the USB-C connectors. Try flipping the USB-C connecter over. If that doesn't work, any spares from USB-C cellphones will likely be fine as they'll be guaranteed to have all the connections and thicker wire suitable for USB 3.0 power delivery.[^1]
