The Sofle Pico has tenting puck mounting holes. Tenting pucks allow for the attachment of camera tripods. The pucks can be attached using four M2 5mm screws. The acrylic, FDM and PCB cases all have holes in the key plate to allow the attachment of the pucks after assembly is complete. 

The tenting puck footprints are designed specifically for use with the [aluminium SplitKB tenting pucks](https://splitkb.com/products/tenting-puck), or the 3d printable version from [Bubbleology](https://www.printables.com/model/235433-tenting-puck-for-keyboard-tripod-mount/comments/943096). 

The tenting pucks use 1/4-20 UNC threads, (1/4th inch thread) which are used in _most_ consumer cameras and tripods. These [Manfrotto pocket supports](https://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-MP3-BK-Large-Pocket-Support/dp/B00HCAB8MU/) are a popular option. Be wary of the depth of the bolt - a long bolt could go through the puck and crack the board. (Long bolts are uncommon, but not unheard of).
