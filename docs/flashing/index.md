# Sofle Pico Firmware and programming
The RP2040 supports 'drag and drop' flashing with a UF2 file on Mac or PC. This is the recommended approach if you're not familiar with compiling QMK firmware yourself.

After the first 'drag and drop' flash, you can tweak your keymaps further using VIA.

Alternately, you can compile your own firmware using QMK.
