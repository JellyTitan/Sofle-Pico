# Acrylic case ordering guide

How to order a custom cut acrylic case from a vendor. This is helpful info if it's your first time ordering a laser cut acrylic. Keep in mind, nobody can guarantee that there are not going to be some problems. If this is your first time, it might be more difficult to deal with any issues along the way.

Most custom fabrication vendors have a similar ordering process. For acrylic I use [Elecrow](https://www.elecrow.com/acrylic-cutting.html) because they are usually the most cost effective. The minimum order quantity (MOQ) is 5 pieces. Pricing is based on dimensions. Some vendors will auto-detect the dimensions when you upload a file for production, and some don't. Anything under 100x100mm is often eligible for 'promotional pricing'. This _should_ apply to the OLED covers. Some acrylic colors cost more than others. As of November 2023, it was ~$25 total to get 1 MOQ of each plate. (That's 2.5 Sofle sets).

<small>*If the download links aren't working, check [the repo](https://github.com/JellyTitan/Sofle-Pico/tree/main/Sofle_Pico/Case/Acrylic_case) for the latest version*</small>

Elecrow requests zipped `.dxf` files and a .`pdf`. You can ignore the request for `pdf`. 

1. Download the acrylic case zipped `.dxf` files from the links above or directly from [the repo](https://github.com/JellyTitan/Sofle-Pico/tree/main/Sofle_Pico/Case/Acrylic_case).
2. Start at the [elecrow acrylic ordering page](https://www.elecrow.com/acrylic-cutting.html), and upload or drag and drop the `dxf.zip` file. (You'll have to add each plate to the order separately, there is no bulk upload option.)
3. Manually enter the dimensions to update pricing.
4. Adjust quantity, or leave at the default of 5.
5. Select 3mm for the acrylic.
6. The remainder of the checkout process is standard ecommerce stuff.
