# About the acrylic case
![Acrylic case render](sofle_pico_acrylic_case.png)

The production ready files for upload can be found in the "production_ready" folder. They are zipped .dxf files. I recommend 3mm thickness.

If you make a set, can you submit a PR with some pictures?

## About these plates
This case was created by exporting svg layers directly from KiCad. The Svg's were imported into Fusion360 with a 3.7795% scale. (Not sure why the KiCad exports are so small - but that multiplier seems to get them where they need to go). From Fusion360, the outlines are exported as a .dxf. The .dxf's have been zipped because the only vendor I've tested these with is Elecrow. If you need another file type, you can find the initial svg's in the 'source' folder.
